/**
 * Which loop runs a turn.
 *
 * `orchestrated` — direct model APIs (local servers, cloud APIs). We own the loop:
 *                  stream → execute tool calls → append results → iterate, under the
 *                  iteration cap.
 *
 * `supervised`   — agent CLIs. The CLI owns its own loop and executes its own tools;
 *                  its adapter renders that activity as text rather than as `tool_call`
 *                  chunks, precisely so nothing is executed twice. We forward the turn,
 *                  re-broadcast what comes back, and bound it by how long it goes quiet
 *                  for rather than by iterations. Our distinctive tools reach that loop
 *                  through the MCP gateway, which calls back into `sessionActions`.
