 * Run a supervised turn.

 * The gateway is attached first and its endpoint travels with the request, so
 * the CLI is handed OpenBOT's tools on its own command line for this turn
 * rather than through anything written to the user's config. A backend that
 * cannot take a server at run time gets none, and no listener is opened for it.
 *
 * The turn is then bounded by SILENCE, not by how long it takes. One timer
 * around the whole turn killed a CLI that had been streaming steadily for
 * twenty minutes — an ordinary long refactor, not a hang — and then told the
 * user it had produced nothing. Every chunk rearms the clock, so what it
 * catches is the case it was always meant to: a process that has stopped
 * saying anything at all.
