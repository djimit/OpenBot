/**
 * Session and bot reads/writes.
 *
 * A thin layer over the stores: it keeps the loop's async surface, and defaults the
 * fields the loop relies on (`computerTarget`, the message and todo arrays) so a bot
 * or session written by an older build cannot crash a turn.
 *
 * There is deliberately no `save(session)` here. A turn holds one `Session` for its
 * whole length, across every stream and tool await, while the user renames the chat,
 * an agent CLI writes todos through the MCP gateway, and messages are appended. Saving
 * that held object verbatim writes a snapshot over everything those wrote — the store
 * persists exactly what it is handed, by contract. `update` is the only write path, and
 * it refreshes before it mutates.
