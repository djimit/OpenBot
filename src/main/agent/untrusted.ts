/**
 * Text OpenBOT did not write, on its way into another bot's prompt.
 *
 * A handoff brief is quoted from the sending bot's own reply, and that reply may
 * itself be quoting a web page, a file or a tool result. The multi-bot protocol
 * is a trailing `ACTION: <VERB>` line, so copied text that can print `ACTION:`
 * — or a newline, or a bidi override — can speak the protocol on the receiving
 * bot's behalf and move the floor to wherever the page said.
 *
 * `src/main/skills/prompt.ts` already defangs skill frontmatter this way and for
 * the same reason; the rules are deliberately identical, so there is one answer
 * to "how does copied text get into a prompt here" rather than two.
