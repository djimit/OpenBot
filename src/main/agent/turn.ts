/**
 * One model round-trip: build the context, stream the reply, and — when we own the loop —
 * run whatever tools it asked for.
 *
 * The outer iteration and its caps belong to `loop.ts`. This module only describes the
 * outcome of a single turn; it never decides to keep going.
 *
 * In `supervised` mode the backend is an agent CLI running its own loop: it executes its
 * own tools and its adapter renders that as text, so there is nothing here to execute and
 * the turn always ends after one pass.
 *
 * The pieces of a turn live beside it: `chatRequest.ts` assembles the backend request,
 * `turnAction.ts` reads the multi-bot ACTION line, `calls.ts` runs the tool calls, and
 * `turnTypes.ts` holds the shapes. All of them are re-exported from here.
