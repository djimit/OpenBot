/**
 * Installing and removing skills.
 *
 * An install copies a folder the user picked into `~/.agents/skills/<name>` —
 * the shared directory every CLI reads — so the user installs once instead of
 * once per CLI. The copy lands in a hidden staging folder first and is renamed
 * into place, so a failed copy never leaves half a skill behind. Replacing an
 * installed skill renames the old one aside first and only deletes it once the
 * new one has landed, so a crash mid-install always leaves one of the two
 * recoverable; `sweepStaleSkillInstalls` finishes the job on the next launch.
 *
 * Removal only ever touches `~/.agents/skills`. The CLIs' own directories are
 * theirs: we did not put those skills there and we do not delete them.
 *
 * Containment rules: the destination is verified to sit inside the shared
 * directory after `realpath`; the copy itself, with its symlink and size
 * guards, lives in `copy.ts`.
