 * The native tools droid may keep, verified against `droid exec --list-tools`.

 * we can reach, so nothing it does natively can be routed to OpenBOT's gate —
 * it was running with its full tool set, unattended, while `chatRequest.ts`
 * documented its `approve` callback as the only place a droid mutation could be
 * stopped. `--enabled-tools` is droid's own restriction flag and it is an
 * allowlist, so a tool added by a later release is excluded by default rather
 * than silently granted. Every other adapter draws the same line: claude
 * `--tools Read,Glob,…`, pi `--tools read`, opencode `permission: 'deny'`.
 *
 * Note that `--auto` is NOT the flag for this: every level of it is an
 * escalation above droid's default read-only autonomy, never a restriction.
