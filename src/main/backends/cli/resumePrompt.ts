/**
 * What a RESUMED agent-CLI turn actually sends.
 *
 * A resumed conversation is already held by the CLI, so re-sending the whole
 * transcript hands it every earlier turn a second time. Sending only the newest
 * user message is the opposite failure, and the one that shipped: in a
 * multi-bot session the newest user message is the moderator's floor brief, so
 * the teammate's reply and the user's own question never reached the model at
 * all — captured stdin showed the CLI receiving nothing but "[moderator] …".
 *
 * What is new is therefore computed rather than guessed. Each turn records a
 * fingerprint per message; the next turn sends everything past the longest
 * prefix the CLI has already been given. A transcript re-budgeted between turns
 * simply shares a shorter prefix, so the failure mode is sending a little too
 * much — never too little.
