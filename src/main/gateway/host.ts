/**
 * The persistence hooks a gateway tool call gets (`ToolHost`).
 *
 * Without these the tool layer still runs, but `remember` would fall back to a
 * private JSON file the app never reads and `handoff` could not name a bot. The
 * whole point of the gateway is that a CLI's own loop reaches OpenBOT's durable
 * state, so the hooks are wired to the same stores the in-app loop uses — and,
 * where the loop puts a rule in front of a store, to the same rule: memory is
 * screened and a hand-off is capped whichever side the call came from.
 *
 * Tools emit their own `AgentEvent`s; these functions only persist.
