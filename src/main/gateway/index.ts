/**
 * The gateway's public surface: attach a supervised session, detach it again.
 *
 * `src/main/agent/mcpGateway.ts` loads this module through `import.meta.glob`,
 * which is why the barrel has to exist as a file rather than as a set of named
 * imports — the glob pattern names `../gateway/index.ts` exactly, and with no
 * such file it compiles to an empty map. That is what happened: all eleven
 * modules under `src/main/gateway` were absent from every build, so every
 * agent-CLI session ran without OpenBOT's computer-use, `remember`, `handoff`
 * and routine tools, announced only by a `console.warn` nobody reads.
 *
 * Attaching mints a bearer grant scoped to one bot in one session and starts
 * the loopback HTTP server if it is not already up. Nothing is written to any
 * config file the user owns: the endpoint and token live for the session and
 * are handed to the CLI on its own command line for that turn.
