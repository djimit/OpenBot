/**
 * Everything that has to be torn down before the process goes away.
 *
 * The child processes OpenBOT starts — pooled agent-CLI servers, per-bot Chrome
 * instances — outlive the app if nobody stops them, so quitting leaves orphans
 * holding ports and profile locks that the next launch then fights with.
 *
 * The owning modules are reached the same way the rest of the main process
 * reaches its optional peers: `import.meta.glob` compiles to an empty map when
 * the file is absent, so a build without the agent or tool layer still quits
 * cleanly, and neither module is pulled into the startup path just to be
 * available at the end of it.
