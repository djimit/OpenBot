/**
 * Barrel for the shared contract.
 *
 * The contract lives in focused modules alongside this file; import from here
 * when you want several of them, or from the specific module when you want one.
 *
 *   chat.ts      messages, tool calls, attachments
 *   bots.ts      bot personas and memory
 *   computer.ts  where a bot's GUI interaction happens (host vs. VM)
 *   routines.ts  record & replay
 *   sessions.ts  sessions and exchanges
 *   backends.ts  model backends (local and cloud are peers)
 *   settings.ts  user settings
 *   tools.ts     tool schemas and the approval vocabulary
 *   events.ts    the canonical main -> renderer event union
 *   api.ts       the IPC surface on window.openbot
