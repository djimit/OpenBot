 * The two text fields that hand Escape on to the app.
 *
 * Every other one swallows it, so a draft survives the keypress (see
 * `shortcutRules`). These two carry no draft and would each lose something real:
 *
 *  - the composer promises "Running — Esc to stop" in its own placeholder, and
 *    has no Escape handler of its own — its `onKeyDown` claims Enter and defers
 *    to the @ picker, nothing more.
 *  - the command palette autofocuses this input on open and traps Tab inside
 *    itself, and has no close button. Swallowing Escape there would leave a
 *    keyboard user with no way out of it at all.
