 * in one commit: opening a 500-turn chat froze the window, and the workspace
 * multiplied it, because up to six unfocused panes each rendered their entire
 * history as a snapshot.
 *
 * A conversation is read from the bottom, so the newest turns are rendered and
 * the rest stays one click away.
