 * Without a trap, focus walks straight out of the panel and into the app behind
 * the scrim: the user keeps typing into a composer they cannot see, and on an
 * approval card the buttons they are being asked about are no longer the ones
 * their keyboard is on.
 *
 * Traps are registered in a module-level stack because two dialogs really can
 * be open at once — an approval arrives while Settings is open, or the user
 * hits a shortcut behind an approval. Every trap listens on `document`, so
 * without the stack *both* handlers ran for one Tab: each saw focus in the
 * other panel, each pulled it back, and focus stuck to a single control with
 * the browser's own move never happening. Only the top of the stack acts.
 *
 * Only for genuinely modal surfaces. An inline disclosure — an expandable tool
 * call, an accordion — must NOT trap: the content is part of the page, and
 * trapping there strands keyboard users on a region they cannot leave.
