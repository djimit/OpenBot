# Third-Party Notices

OpenBOT is distributed with, and adapted from, the open-source projects listed
below. Their licence terms are reproduced here and continue to apply.

Two kinds of entry appear:

- **Bundled** — the code is compiled into a shipped OpenBOT binary. Several of
  these licences require the notice to travel with the binary, which is what
  this file is for.
- **Adapted** — no upstream code ships, but OpenBOT source was derived from it.

## Bundled: highlight.js

Compiled into the renderer bundle; it does the syntax highlighting in code
blocks.

## Bundled: React and React DOM

Compiled into the renderer bundle; they are the UI runtime. Both packages ship
the same licence text.

## Bundled: Electron

OpenBOT ships as an Electron application, so the Electron runtime — and the
Chromium and Node.js it embeds — is redistributed inside the app bundle.
Electron's own licence is below. The licences of everything Chromium vendors
run to ~20 MB, so they are not duplicated here: the build copies Electron's own
`LICENSES.chromium.html` into `OpenBOT.app/Contents/Resources` instead, next to
this file and to `LICENSE`. electron-builder does not do that on its own — see
`extraResources` in `package.json`.

- Project: electron 43.4.0
- Source: https://github.com/electron/electron
- Licence: MIT

## Adapted: Synara

Portions of OpenBOT's agent-CLI backend layer — in particular the transport
patterns for wrapping locally installed coding agents (login-shell environment
hydration, server-mode discovery via stdout scraping, JSON-RPC session
handling, per-CLI detection metadata, and the canonical provider event model) —
are adapted from Synara.

## Notes on provenance

OpenBOT is an independent, clean-room reimplementation with respect to any
proprietary application. Where OpenBOT's feature set resembles a commercial
product, that resemblance derives from observed behaviour and published
descriptions only — no proprietary source code has been copied, decompiled into,
or redistributed as part of this project.
